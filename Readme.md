# Gif of glasto webcam

## TODO
- Host it on a static site (add iframe to live / links to sources)
- Build each day at the end of the day + commit it
- Host the videos somewhere else? github kinda not for that?
- Backup all the images somewhere? probably not.

## Ideas
- There are more HD images we could use
- Zoom on interesting areas so it's not crazy landscape
- Pan automatically across the site across the day
- ???
